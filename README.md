# Persistent Search Trees

This repository holds the visualization of persistent binary search trees implemented with the fat node method. The fat node method is introduced in [this paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sleator/papers/making-data-structures-persistent.pdf) by Driscoll et al.. 

## To do

- [ ] The layout algorithm is a bit ad-hoc.
- [ ] The trees are not recentered after zooming in/out.
